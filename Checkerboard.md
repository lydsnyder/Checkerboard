1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

I think I did fairly well on this challenge. My finished product works correctly. Comparing to the solution code, it seems I still didn't get the MVC separation quite right. 

For me, the "hard" part was figuring out what concepts go where in MVC as well as using the ChangeListener method properly.

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

I had a lot of trouble with lambda functions and ChangeListener, which I know were what we needed to use to make the board's corners draggable. I ended up getting some help / some explanation from a few other students that had taken the course previously.

Everything else I felt pretty solid on. At that point, though, I guess I was a little confused about what is exactly should be made private, so I made pretty much everything private except for the getters and setters. 

3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

It seems like in Startable I edited and set a few UI elements. I'm pretty sure I should not have done that and should have set the elemets in the FXML / UI file.

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

My solution matches pretty closely.

My startable function has some of the UI elements. In my FXML, I use a VBOX instead of a stage. I have a lot less elements in my UI file than in the solution.

I was pretty busy at the time of the challenge, so I was aware that I could have made my menu handling (switching the size of the board) more efficient. I spent a little bit of time making the code look nicer, but I eventually decided that it worked and I should turn the assignment in. The solution's use of a switch statement is a great solution to the issue I had with all of my individual functions for each board size click.

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

I feel like I could definitely better understand ChangeListener. I also could have set aside more time to make my code cleaner and more compact. I struggled to understand MVC in CS3330, and I think that my understanding from that class mixed with various explanations from peers confused me. I think I understand much better given that I was pretty close with matching the MVC model.
